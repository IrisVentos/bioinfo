# Bioinformatics Code Challenges
A collection of computational biology exercises exploring fundamental problems in bioinformatics, from finding DNA replication origins to genome sequencing and assembly.

📚 ## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various bioinformatics algorithms and solutions to computational challenges in genomics. Each section tackles a different aspect of computational biology, building from basic pattern matching to complex genome analysis.

🧬 ## Contents

### **Part 1: DNA Replication & Motif Finding**
Explores the biological mechanisms of genome replication and the computational methods to identify replication origins.

### Key Topics:
-Finding Origins of Replication: Identifying ori regions where DNA replication begins
-Pattern Matching: Locating specific DNA sequences within genomes
-Motif Finding: Discovering recurring patterns in DNA that serve as binding sites for proteins
-Planted Motif Search: Finding subtle patterns hidden across multiple DNA sequences

### Biological Context:
Transcription factors and their binding sites
Molecular clocks in bacterial genomes

Case study: Mycobacterium tuberculosis dormancy response
Investigating hypoxia-triggered dormancy
Identifying transcription factors involved in the dormancy regulon

Applications:
Understanding bacterial survival mechanisms
Drug target identification
Regulatory network analysis

### **Part 2: Genome Sequencing & Assembly**
Addresses the computational challenge of reconstructing complete genomes from fragmented DNA reads.

### Key Topics:
-DNA Sequencing: Determining the precise order of nucleotides in a genome
-Read Generation: Breaking genomes into smaller, overlapping fragments (reads)
-Sequence Assembly: Reconstructing the original genome by finding overlaps between reads
-Graph-Based Approaches: Using computational graph theory for genome assembly

### Computational Challenges:
Handling millions of short DNA reads
Resolving ambiguous overlaps
Dealing with sequencing errors
Managing repetitive genomic regions

Methods Covered:
Overlap-layout-consensus assembly
String reconstruction from read pairs
k-mer analysis



Parts 3-5: Coming Soon
Additional bioinformatics topics and algorithms will be added.
